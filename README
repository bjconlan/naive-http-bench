# NOTES (order of preference)
userver: uses http 1.1. Is very slow when enabling TLS but very fast when not (also note its using GMT by default not localtime - code could use improvement)

kestral: Attempts to use more advanced http protocols but ab isn't compatable so fallsback to http 1.1

go: By far the neatest codebase, using HTTP 1.1, surpisingly slower then kestral when performing TLS termination

readbean: Only used HTTP 1.0, Lua is nice (only not compiled server here); still not sure how I feel about this ecosystem
          (perhaps still the most disliked since the learning curve is there moresoe than golang but not a showstopper)
